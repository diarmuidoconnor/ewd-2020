# API Documentation 

To make the API more useable, lets serve auto-generated swagger-ui generated API docs from the express application, based on the swagger.yaml file that's already in the repo from last weeks lab. The idea here is that this becomes a living document for your API hosted from your API server via it's own route route.

In order for this part to work, you will need to have completed part 6 of last weeks lab which created a *swagger.yaml* file in your repo. If not, please complete that part of the lab and do  ``git pull`` in your local repository (or else retrieve it from https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/fxwalsh/Movie/lab1-simple). Your file strucure in *ewd-api-labs-2020* should look as follows:

- Install Swagger UI Express and YamlJS in the *node-lab1* folder
 
 ~~~bash
 npm install -s swagger-ui-express yamljs
 ~~~

- In *index.js*, add the following to the import declarations. 

~~~javascript
import swaggerUi from 'swagger-ui-express';
import YAML from 'yamljs';
~~~

- Add the following line of code to load the Swagger Document

~~~javascript
const swaggerDocument = YAML.load('./../movie-api-yaml/swagger.yaml');
~~~

- Finally add the route to the app.

~~~javascript
app.use('/api/docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));
~~~

- In a browser, request http://localhost:8080/api/docs/. You should see the generated documentation for the API.
