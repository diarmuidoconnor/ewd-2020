# Express Applications

We'll now add some static content to our web server.  We'll now move to Express, a richer web app package and provides a nice high level approach to serving up static content. It's based around the idea of creating an Express "app" that you can easily configure. One of the configuration options allows you to specify the location of your publicly available content such as static HTML, CSS, client-side Javascript files etc.

## Express

To create an Express app, we need to install it as a **normal dependency**.

- Install the express package **in the node-lab1 folder**.

~~~bash
npm install --save express
~~~

The ``--save`` flag will write this dependency to package.json.

## Routing using Express

Express gives us an easy way of mapping specific URL paths to Javascript functions. You will now replicate the functionality from the "Hello World" section so that a **HTTP GET** request for the URL path  '/greeting/' will respond with "Hello World". Modify the index.js by adding an ``app.get([route],[callback function])``.

In the absence of Unit/Integration tests, you will need a HTTP client to manually test your APIs. Postman is currently one of the most popular tools used in API testing. 

You can download it [here](https://www.postman.com/).

There are also some good documentation on how to use it to test APIs. It will be used in the following exercises to rest the APIs...

**Note**: there are other tools you can use also - feel free to opt for them if you wish.


### Movies API

 Ultimately we would like our API to use a database such as Mongo and allow for a more realistic API that can cope with large volumes of data you would expect in a production environment.

- Create a new folder called **api** in **node-lab-1** folder. Create another folder called **movies** in **api**. Your folder structure should look as follows:  

~~~
+node-lab-1
    |-api
       |-movies
~~~

We will use the same test data from the Swagger specification in our last lab. 

- Create a new file called **movies.js** in the movies folder and add the following code:  

~~~javascript
export const moviesObject = {
    "page": 1,
    "results": [
        {

- Also in the movies folder, create a new file called **index.js** and enter the following javascript:

~~~javascript
import express from 'express';
import { moviesObject } from './movies';

const router = express.Router(); 
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(moviesObject);
});

export default router;
~~~


- Now update **index.js** in the **root** folder to use the new movies routing script by replacing the entire contents with the following code:

~~~javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import express from 'express';
import moviesRouter from './api/movies';

dotenv.config();

const app = express();

const port = process.env.PORT;

app.use('/api/movies', moviesRouter);
app.use(express.static('public'));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.info(`Server running at ${port}`);
});
~~~

- Now test the application again by doing a HTTP GET on ``localhost:8080/api/movies``. You should see something similar to the following:
