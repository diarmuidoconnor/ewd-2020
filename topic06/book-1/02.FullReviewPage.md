## Full Review Page.

Each review extract on the Movie Details page has a link to display a new page showing the full text of the review. 

Create the file `src/components/movieReview/index.js` and add this code:
~~~
import React from "react";

export default ({ review }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>Review By: {review.author} </p>
      <p>{review.content} </p>
    </>
  );
};
~~~

Create the file `src/pages/movieReviewPage.js` and add this code:
~~~
import React from "react";
import PageTemplate from '../components/templateMoviePage'
import MovieReview from "../components/movieReview";

const MovieReviewPage = (props) => {
  return (
      <PageTemplate movie={props.location.state.movie}>
        <MovieReview review={props.location.state.review} /> 
      </PageTemplate>
  );
};

export default MovieReviewPage;
~~~
Recall:

1. This page is rendered when the user clicks a review excerpt link on the movie details page. The link included two objects (movie and review). These objects are available to the above page via the location prop (props.location.state)
1. The template page component supports component composition, i.e. the overall page is a composition of the template and the MovieReview components.

The final step is to add a new route for this page to `src/indecx.js`:
~~~
<Switch>
    <Route path="/reviews/:id" component={MovieReviewPage} />
    . . . other routes . . .
</Switch>
~~~

In the browser:

1. Go to the home page and click a movie.
1. In the movie details page click Show Reviews and click one of the review excerpts.
