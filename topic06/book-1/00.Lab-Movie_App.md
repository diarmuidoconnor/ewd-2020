# Developing a Movies Fan App.

in this lab we will complete the Movie Fan app, based on the feature list mentioned in an earlier lab. The remaining features are:

+ On the Movies detail page show an excerpt from each review published by the TMDB API for a movie.
+ Allow the user to see the full text of a review, by clicking its 'More' link.
+ Allow the user write their own review of a favorite movie. 

Also, known bugs identified in the previous lab need fixing. 

A number of React technical topics will be used to meet the above requirements, including:

+ The Render props pattern.
+ Nested routes.
+ Component composition pattern.
+ The Context API
+ Custom hooks.
+ 3rd party hooks, e.g. useForm.
