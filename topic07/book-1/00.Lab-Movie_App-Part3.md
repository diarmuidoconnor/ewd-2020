# Developing a Movies Fan App.

in this lab we will complete the Movies Fan app, based on the feature list mentioned in an earlier lab. 

The remaining features are:

+ The Movie details page optionally show an excerpt from each related critic review published by the TMDB API.
+ Clicking the 'More' link on an excerpt displays the full text of a review on a seperate page.
+ The user write their own review of a favorite movie. 

Also, known bugs identified in the previous lab will be fixed. 

A number of React technical topics will be used to meet the above requirements, including:

+ The Render props pattern.
+ Nested routes.
+ Component composition pattern.
+ The Context API
+ Custom hooks.
+ 3rd party hooks, e.g. useForm.
