## GlobalState and Contexts.

A common feature of React apps is where part of its state is required by many components. For example, the current authenticated user is often required by many components in an app. In the implementation this can lead to 'prop drilling', where components in the middle of the component hierarchy transmit props from high-level components to low-level components. The middle-tier components do not use the props themselves. 

Another common problem leading to poor implementation is when a component requests API data every time it mounts, even though the data is unchanged. This case arises in our app in relation to the list of movies and the list of genres. The genres never change, while the movie list may change between app runs but not during a single execution session.

React's Context concept solves both of these problems. It is a realisation of the Provider pattern.

### The Movie list context.

Create the file `src/contexts/moviesContext.js` and add this code:
~~~
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import StubAPI from "../api/stubAPI";
import { getMovies } from "../api/tmdb-api";

export const MoviesContext = React.createContext(null)

const MoviesContextProvider = props => {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);

  const addToFavorites = movieId => {
    setMovies(movies => {
      const index = movies.map(m => m.id).indexOf(movieId);
      StubAPI.add(movies[index]);
      movies.splice(index, 1);
      return [...movies];
    });
  };
  useEffect(() => {
    getMovies().then(movies => {
      setMovies(movies);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <MoviesContext.Provider
      value={{
        movies: movies,
        addToFavorites: addToFavorites
      }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </MoviesContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default MoviesContextProvider
~~~
The MoviesContextProvider component now manages the loading and modifying (addToFavorites) of the movie list. It uses component composition (props.children), which allows us merge it with other components that reference movies. In addition, we make the component a *context provider* by enclosing its JSX with 'MoviesContext.Provider'. It gives other components access to the movies array and addToFavorites function, termed the provider's *values*.

In `src/index.js`:

+ add an import
~~~
import MoviesContextProvider from "./contexts/moviesContext";
~~~

+ and modify the App component:
~~~
const App = () => {
  return (
    <MoviesContextProvider>
      <BrowserRouter>
        . . . . as before . . . . 
      </BrowserRouter>
    </MoviesContextProvider>
~~~

This is the other side of the component composition pattern involving MoviesContextProvider - we are composing it with the rest of our app. 
Because MoviesContextProvider is a context provider, it means all components in our app can now access its values, subject to a small code addition. In particular, `pages/homePage.js` accesses the movies list. In fact most of that component's functionality has moved to the the context provider component. Completely replace its code with the following:
~~~
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import PageTemplate from '../components/templateMovieListPage'
import {MoviesContext} from '../contexts/moviesContext'

const MovieListPage = () => {
  const context = useContext(MoviesContext);

  return (
      <PageTemplate 
        title='All Movies'
        movies={context.movies}
        buttonHandler={context.addToFavorites}
      />
  );
};

export default MovieListPage;
~~~
The important line above is:
~~~
  const context = useContext(MoviesContext);
~~~
It allows the component access any value exposed by the context, e.g.
~~~
context.movies
and
context.addToFavorites
~~~

These changes have also fixed a bug identified in an earlier lab. Try the following sequence:

1. Go to the home page.
1. Click the 'Add to favorites' button of the first three movies, 
1. The selected movies are removed from the home page, leaving 17 in the list. 
1. Navigate to the Favorites page.
1. Navigate back to the Home page. It still has only 17 movies, as we would expect. The app did not re-request the full list of movies from the API.

### The Genre list context.

Create the file `src/contexts/genresContext.js` and add this code:
~~~
import React, { useState, useEffect, createContext } from "react";
import { getGenres } from "../api/tmdb-api";

export const GenresContext = createContext(null)

const GenresContextProvider = props => {
    const [genres, setGenres] = useState([{ id: "0", name: "All" }]);
    useEffect(() => {
      getGenres().then(allGenres => {
        setGenres([genres[0], ...allGenres]);
      });
    }, []);

    return (
        <GenresContext.Provider
          value={{
            genres
          }}
        >
          {props.children}
        </GenresContext.Provider>    
    )
}

export default GenresContextProvider;
~~~

This context is only required (for now) by the FilterControls component. In `src/components/templateMoviesListPage/index.js`:

+ add an import:
~~~
import GenresContextProvider from "../../contexts/genresContext";
~~~

+ and compose the context provider with FilterControls:
~~~
  return (
    <>
      . . . as before . . .
      <GenresContextProvider>
        <FilterControls
          onUserInput={handleChange}
          numMovies={displayedMovies.length}
        />
      </GenresContextProvider>
      . . . as before . . .
    </>
  );
~~~
Finally, in `compoonents/filterControls/index.js` completely replace the code with the following:
~~~
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import "./filterControls.css";
import { GenresContext } from '../../contexts/genresContext' 

const FilterControls = props => {
  const context = useContext(GenresContext);

  const handleChange = (e, type, value) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    props.onUserInput(type, value);
  };
  const handleTextChange = e => {
    handleChange(e, "name", e.target.value);
  };
  const handleGenreChange = e => {
    handleChange(e, "genre", e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div className="row bg-warning">
      <div className="col-md-12">
        <h4>
          <span>List Filtering:</span>
          <input
            type="text"
            placeholder="Title Search"
            onChange={handleTextChange}
          />
          <span>Genre:</span>
          <select id="genre" onChange={handleGenreChange}>
            {context.genres.map(genre => {
              return (
                <option key={genre.id} value={genre.id}>
                  {genre.name}
                </option>
              );
            })}
          </select>
        </h4>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default FilterControls;
~~~
The changes to this component include:

1. The useState and useEffect code has moved to the context provider.
1. The Select dropdown is populated by entries from the context.

From the integrated terminal panel, update the git repository, as follows:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Refactor: Movie list and genre list stored in contexts"
