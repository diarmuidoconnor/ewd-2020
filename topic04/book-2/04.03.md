## The Bootstrap CSS library.

The styling problem is due to our omission of the Bootstrap CSS file. Stop the server and install it as follows:
~~~
$ npm install --save  bootstrap@4.4.1
$ npm start
~~~
The traditional approach (which we won't use) to referencing CSS is by adding a link tag to `index.html`:
~~~
<link href="... path to CSS file ..." rel="stylesheet">
~~~
A newer and more developer-friendly approach is to reference it directly from the JS code. In `src/index.js` add the following line (at the top):
~~~
import '../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
~~~
The app should now be rendering as planned. 

From the `course-app` folder commit this work:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Styled with Bootstrap"
~~~
