## Start-up.

Download [this archive][start], unzip it and import it into VS Code. Open an integrate terminal and run:
~~~
$ npm install
~~~
This is a skeleton create-react-app project. The `src` folder has been divided into  a number of subfolders to reflect the different code elements that make up a React app.

Our planned Movie app will be communicating with The TMDB API (Note: We are using version 3 of the API). All requests to the API are authenticated by an API KEY. Yo acquire a personal key:

+ Signup for and account [here][signup]. 
+ Log in to your account and clicking the "API" link in the left hand side bar of your account page.

In VS Code, create a new file called `.env` with the following content:
~~~
REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY=[ . . . your API key value . . . ]
~~~
Later in our code we will use the environment variable REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY in HTTP calls to the API. 

It is extremely important to keep you key private. For example, never include it in a project pushed up to GitHub. In VS Code, open the `.gitignore` file and add the line:
~~~
.env
~~~
This ensures the `.env` file us never uploaded to GitHub.

*Thinking in React* is a simple development process recommended by the React design team (discussed in a later lectures). This lab is focused on first step of this process, titled `Build a static version` of the app. In subsequent labs we will add user interaction and routing.
