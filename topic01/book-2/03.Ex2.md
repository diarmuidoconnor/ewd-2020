## Exercise 2.

Create a new file in lab02, called `exercise2.js`. Use the same fetch statement as Exercise 1 to request a list (200) of todos.

In the body of the fetch, you are required to write the code that extracts the titles of all the todos and displays them. Use the Array.Map HOF in your solution. The output should look as follows:

![][titles]

After completing a solution, update the git repository:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 2"
~~~
[titles]: ./img/titles.png
