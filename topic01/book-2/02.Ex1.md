## Exercise 1.

Create a new file in lab02, called `exercise1.js` and paste in this code:

~~~
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(json => {
     const completed = [Complete this code]
     console.log(completed)
  })
  .catch(function(err) { 
    console.log(err);
  });
~~~

You are required to complete the above script so that the console.log statement displays only the completed todos. Use the Array.filter Higher Order Function in your solution.

Test your solution by referencing the script file from `index.html`.

After completing a solution, update the git repository:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 1"
~~~
