## Start-up.

### Install VS Code extension.

In your VS Code editor, click the *Extensions* icon on the Activity bar (left-hand side menu) and search for the `Live Server` extension. Click its Install button.

### The Lecture code samples.

Download and unzip the sample code ([here][source]) demonstrated in the JS lecture. Import the samples into VS Code and start the Live Server by clicking the 'Go Live' link on the Status bar:

![][live]

This opens a new browser tab. Open the Developer Tools in the browser:

![][devtool]

In VS Code, open the `index.html` file and uncomment the `01_primitives.js` script. On saving this change, the Live Server reloads the page in the browser:

![][primitives]

In `index.html` comment out the `01_primitives.js` script and uncomment the '02_objects.js` script. The Live server reloads the page again: 

![][objects]

Leave the server running - to stop it at any time click the `Port 55xx` link in VS Code's Status Bar:

![][stop]

### Git configuration.

For this module you must ensure that Git is configured properly. In particular, the username must be set to your full name (as recorded on Moodle, for example) - not your GitHub name. In VS Code open an integrated terminal (if one is not already open):

![][session]

From the terminal prompt type the following to set the user name:
[Note: By convention we use the dollar symbol ($) to represent the terminal prompt.]
~~~
$ git config --global user.name " .... your name ..."
~~~
e.g. git config --global user.name "Diarmuid O Connor"

Now check this worked:
~~~
$ git config --global user.name
~~~

### Lab starter code.

Create a new folder (away from `dataSamples`), called `lab001`, and in it create two files:

+ `index.html`:
~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Lab 001</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>JS Data</h1>
    <script src="./fundamentals.js "></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~
+ and `fundamentals.js`:
~~~
const aCar = {
	owner : "Joe Bloggs",
	type : 'Toyota Corolla 1.8',
	registration : '201WD1058'
};

console.log(aCar.owner);
~~~

In VS code, open a second window:

![][window]

Import the `lab001` folder into this window. Start the Live Server from this window - we can have multiple instances of the server running where each instance uses a different port number. In the newly opened browser tab, open the Developer Tools. Its Console tab should be displaying 'Joe Bloggs'. Open an integrated terminal in this window and type the commands:
~~~
$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial structure"
~~~
This added a git repository to `lab001`:

![][gitinit]

You now have two instances of Live Server running where each instance is linked to a browser tab. Anytime you change a source code file, Live Server will reload its web page, thus allowing you check the execution of those change.
