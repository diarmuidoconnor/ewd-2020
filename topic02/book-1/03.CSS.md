# Cascading Style Sheets

HTML elements alone will give us a structured page - however it will have a very plain and unattractive appearance. To introduce 'style' into a page we need another language - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This is a different language from HTML and is usually stored in a separate file - the stylesheet.

## CSS

Create a new file called *style.css* and save it into the *stylesheets* folder you created in the last step. Add the following lines of code to the file and save:

~~~css
p
{
  color: maroon; /* Change text colour to maroon
}
~~~

Bind this file into your pages by 'linking' to it in the the ``<head>`` element of each page. Add the following line of code into the head element:

~~~html
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/style.css" />
~~~

Now have a look at the *index.html* page in the browser - you should notice that the text in the paragraph is now maroon in colour. Add the link element to *cars.html* and *directions.html*. Again you will need to adjust the relative reference for each page.

Add the following rules one at a time a observe the effect:

~~~css
h1, h2
{
  color: #007e7e; 
}

h1
{
  font-size: 200%; 
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}

h2
{
  font-size: 130%;
}

  body
{
  width: 80%;  
  margin: 0 auto;
  /*font-family Specifies the font for the element. If he browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font and so on... */
  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; 
  font-size:small;
  line-height: 1.6em;
}

li {
    display: inline;  /*displays list items inline instead of block. 
                        Result is nav bar items displayed horizontally.*/
}
~~~

All going well you should end up with your index.html page looking something like this:

If you want, you can explore the css rules by changing the values and observing the results.

## CSS Class Selectors

The class selector allows you to apply syle rules to elements with a specific class attribute. Add the following paragraph element to your index.html page after the last body.

~~~html
<p>

With a variable rate loan from our financial partners carsharks.com you have the option of making extra repayments and clear your loan early. Lending criteria terms and conditions apply.

</p>
~~~

In the browser, it will appear with the standard style rules specified for paragraphs:

![FIGURE 5](./img/browser5.png)

We want to draw attention to this paragraph in the overall page by applying specific style properties.For example, different font and background colour and add a background image beside the text.

Save the following image, *background.gif*, to the images folder.

![Background](./img/background.gif)

Update the ``<p>`` element by adding a class attribute with the value "finance".

~~~html
<p class='finance'>
~~~

Now open *style.css* and add the following css rule with the appropriate class selector. Notice class selectors begin with a period followed by the class name. This will apply the style rules to all elements with attribute class="finance".

~~~css
.finance
{
  border-color: white;
  border-width: 1px;
  border-style: dashed;

  margin: 30px;
  padding: 25px;
  padding-left: 80px;
  margin-right: 150px;

  background-color: #a7cece;
  background-image: url(../images/background.gif);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top-left;

  line-height: 1.9em;
  font-style: italic;
  font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
  color: black;
}
~~~

View *index.html* in the browser. See how the finance paragraph is now more prominent. Play around with some of the style rules to understand their effect.
