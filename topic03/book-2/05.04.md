## Exercise 4 (Iteration).
 
So far we have be constrained to always having exactly 2 entries in the modules table. The component should be able to handle __any array size__ passed in as a prop. 

__You are required__ to implement your solution to this requirement in `components/exercises/04_iteration.js`. Use `components/samples/04_iteration.js` as a guide.

The story for this exercise is already implemented in `stories/exercises.js`:
~~~
.add("04 - iteration", () => {
   return <CourseModulesCollections modules={modules} course={name} />;
});
~~~

In the UI your solution should render similar to the following:

![][exercise4] 

[See the Solutions tab for an outline solution - Exercise 4]

On completing the exercise, update the local repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 4 completed"
~~~
