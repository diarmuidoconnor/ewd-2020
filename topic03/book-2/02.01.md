## Exercise 1 (Static Component).

__You are required__ to implement a simple (static) React component that renders a view similar to that illustrated below (your solution can use a course title and module names that match your education profile):

![][exercise1]

As a guide, the raw HTML to render the table of modules above would be as follows:
~~~
<table className="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>No lectures</th>
      <th>No practicals</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody >
    <tr>
      <td>DevOps</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Enterprise Web Dev</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody >
</table>
~~~
For now we will only allow exactly two modules in the table. The Storybook story for this exercise is already implemented. In `stories/exercises.stories.js`:
~~~
.add("01 - static component", () => {
   return <CourseModulesStatic />;
})
~~~
The steps to completing this exercise are:

+ __Step 1__: In the Storybook UI, click the link: 'Samples -> 01 - static component'. The related component code is in `components/samples/01_staticComponent.js`.
+ __Step 2__: In the Storybook UI, click the link: 'Exercises -> 01 - static component'. The related code is: `components/exercises/01_staticComponent.js`. Change the component's return statement to produce the desired output. 
+ __Step 3__: Now complete the exercise code using the sample as a guide.

Check how the component is rendering in the UI. Remember, live-reloading is happens every time you perform a file save operation. 

[See the Solutions tab for a sample solution - Exercise 1].

On completion, stop the Storybook server and update the local Git repo:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 1 completed"
~~~
Restart the server:
~~~
$ npm run storybook 
~~~
