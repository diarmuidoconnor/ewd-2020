## Exercise 2 (Embedded variables).

In exercise 1 the data was hard-coded in the JSX - course name, module details. A slight improvement would be to place the data in local variables and reference them from the JSX code as embedded variables, e.g.
~~~
const modules = [
    {
      name: "Agile Software Development",
      noLectures: 2,
      noPracticals: 3
    },
    {
      name: "Enterprise Web Dev",
      noLectures: 3,
      noPracticals: 2
    }
  ];
~~~
__You are required__ to implement this improvement in `components/exercises/02_embeddedVariables.js` - copy the code from Exercise 1 as a starting point. 

The story for this exercise is already implemented in `stories/exercises.js`:
~~~
.add("02 - JSX embedded variables", () => {
   return <CourseModulesEmbeddedVars />;
})
~~~
The steps to completing this exercise are as before:
 
+ __Step 1__: In the UI click the link: 'Samples -> 02 - JSX embedded variables'. Examine the related component code in `components/samples/02_embeddedVariables.js`.
+ __Step 2__: Open the file `components/exercises/02_embeddedVars.js` and copy over the solution code from exercise 1. Now adapt the code to use embedded variables.
+ __Step 3__: In the UI, click the link: 'Exercises -> 02 - JSX embedded variables' to see the result of your implementation. 

Hint: The pseudo-HTML code below is a guide to the solution required:
~~~       
<tr>
   <td>{modules[1].name}</td>
   <td>modules[1].noLectures}</td>
   <td>{modules[1].noPracticals}</td>
</tr>
~~~

[See the Solutions tab for a sample solution - Exercise 2].

On completing the exercise, stop the server and type these commands:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 2 completed"
~~~
Restart the server.
