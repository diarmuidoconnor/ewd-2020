## Exercise 3.

The Array HOFs can be combined, for example, map over the array produced from the filter function:

> const finalResult = sourceArray.filter(......).map(.......)

The input array for map is the output array produced by filter.

Create a new file in functionslab, called `exercise3.js`. Use the same fetch statement as Exercise 1 to request a list of todos.

In the body of the fetch, you are required to write the code that displays objects containing userID and todo title of all todos not yet completed. The output should look as follows:

![][incompleted]

Update the git repository:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 3"
