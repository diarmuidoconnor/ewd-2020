## Start-up.

Download the sample code ([here][source]) supporting the lecture slides and unzip the archive. Import the samples into VS Code and open the `index.html` file. Start the Live Server by clicking the 'Go Live' link on the Status bar. In the browser tab, open the Developer tools and select the Console tab. It should be displaying some users retrieved from the Random User API.

![][random]

You may wish to reference the other scripts in this folder while working through the exercises in this lab.

Stop the Live server.

Unzip [this archive][start] and use it as the starting point for the lab exercises. Import it into VS Code and open `index.html`. The web page references `webAPICall.js` which communicates with a fake web API, [JSONPlaceholder][fake]. It accepts requests for a variety of resources, including, posts, albums, users, todos. Our script code is requesting a list of todos - 200 are returned. Start the Live server. Examine the API response in the browser:

![][todos]

The API returns an array of todos. Each todo has an associated user (userID) and completed status
 and start the Live Server. 

In VS Code, open an integrated terminal window and create a Git repository in the `functionslab` folder:
~~~
$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial structure"
~~~
