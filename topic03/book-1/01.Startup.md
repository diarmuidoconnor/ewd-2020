## Startup.

Download and unzip [this archive][code]. Import them into VS Code. open an integrated terminal (the default folder/directory will be `basicReactLab`) and type:
~~~
$ npm install
~~~
[This installs the JS modules needed (e.g. React, Storybook) in a local folder, called `node_modules`.]

The base folder (`basicReactLab`) contains the following top-level folder structure:
~~~
     basicReactLab
       |
       |--- .storybook
       |--- components
       |      |
       |      |--- exercises
       |      |--- samples
       |
       |--- node_modules
       |--- stories
       package.json
~~~
Your main focus will be on the two sub-folders of `components`. In `components/samples` are the completed sample components covered in the lectures. The `components/exercises` folder has skeleton implementations of the components you will develop during this lab. In the terminal, from the base folder, type:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
[This is a shorthand for the full command: "npx start-storybook -p 6006 -c ./.storybook" - see scripts in `package.json]`.]

The 'start-storybook' executable (located in `./node_modules/.bin` folder) transpiles all ES6 and JSX code (e.g. in `components/samples`) and starts the storybook web server on port 9001. Open a web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:9001

![][storybook] 

This is Storybook's  UI layout.

### The samples.

Each file in the `components/samples` folder contains a component implementation. The file names are prefixed with a sequence number (01_, 02_ etc) to help relate it to the text name that appear in the side panel of the Storybook UI. For example, the component definition in `components/samples/03_props.js` can be seen by clicking: 'Samples -> 03 - component with props' in the UI.

![][numbers] 

Briefly examine some of the other sample components - no need to fully understand the code, yet. Conventionally a component file name matches the component name in the source code. This practice is not applied here purely as a convenience.

The Storybook server provides live-reloading - you can see the effect of code changes immediately. For example, in the UI, click the `01 - static component` sample. Open the file `components/samples/01_staticComponent.js` and change the list of languages to the following:
~~~
<ul>
   <li>Erlang</li> 
   <li>Clojure</li>
</ul>  
~~~
On saving the change, return to the UI and notice the change is automatically refreshed,

### The exercises folder

Click on any of the exercises components in the UI to confirm they are not completed.

![][exercises] 

Leave the Storybook server running while completing this lab's exercises. If you do need to stop it type 'cntl/c'. To restart type:
~~~
$ npm run storybook 
~~~
