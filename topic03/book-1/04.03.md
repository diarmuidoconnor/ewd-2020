## Exercise 3 (Props).

The next design improvement in our case study is __reusability__. This is achieved by passing any model data in as __props__ to a component. Our component's props include:

+ An array of (exactly two) modules and
+ The course name. 

The story for this exercise is already implemented in `stories/exercises.stories.js`:
~~~
.add("03 - component with props", () => {
   const twoModules = [modules[0], modules[1]];
   return <CourseModulesWithProps modules={twoModules} course={name} />;
})
~~~
Implement your solution in `components/exercises/03_props.js`. Use the solution to exercise 2 as the starting point. Reference `components/samples/03_props.js` as a guide to the changes required. Make sure to use the prop names used in the story above:

+ course
+ modules

In the UI, click 'Exercises -> 03 component with props' to see your solution render.

On completing the exercise, stop the server and type these commands:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 3 completed"
~~~

Restart the server.
