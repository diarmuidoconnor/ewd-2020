## Using Live Movie Data.

[ You will need an API key for the TMDB service to complete this section - see the previous lab.]

We want the HomePage to be responsible for retrieving live movie data from the API. In `src/pages/homePage.js` make the changes shown below:
~~~
import React, {useState, useEffect } from "react";
. . . . other imports . . . . . 

const MovieListPage = () => {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(
      `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?api_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY}&language=en-US&include_adult=false&page=1`
    )
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => {
        console.log(json)
        return json.results
      })
      .then(movies => {
        setMovies(movies);
      });
  }, []);
  return (
    <>
    . . . . as before . . . . 
    </>
  );
};

export default MovieListPage;
~~~

Start the development server:
~~~
$ npm start
~~~

The browser should be showing a list of current movie titles:

![][current]

In the above code the useEffect hook is querying the API for a set of movies from its `Discovery` endpoint (read more [here][discovery] ). The URL includes a query string:

>?api_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY}&language=en-US&include_adult=false&page=1

The api_key attribute is used to authenticate the HTTP request. The page attribute indicates the subset of movies being requested. Page can range from 1 to 1000, where 1 means the first 20 movies - 2 means movies 21 to 40, and so on. We have hard-coded it to page 1 for convenience.

Note the last then clause in the fetch call:
~~~
.then(movies => {
    setMovies(movies);
});
~~~
It stores the response (list of movies) in a state variable called *movies* - managed by the useState hook. The second then clause has a console.log statement as an aid to understanding the structure of the response returned by the API. Open the developer tools in the browser and examine the output from the log statement:

![][structure]

Take some time to explore the content of the response's *results* property.

In `src/components/movieCard/index.js`, wrap the img tag in a Link, as follows
~~~
  <Link to={`/movies/${props.movie.id}`}>
    <img
      className="card-img-tag center "
      alt={movie.title}
      src={
        props.movie.poster_path
          ? `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/${props.movie.poster_path}`
          : "./film-poster-placeholder.png"
      }
    />
    </Link>
~~~
also, add an import at the top:
~~~
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
~~~
The effect of Link is when a movie poster image is clicked the browser's address bar is changed. The new URL will match the first Route in the app's routing configuration,

>i.e. <Route path="/movies/:id" component={MoviePage} />

The id is taken from the clicked movie's id property, 

>e.g. http://localhost:3000/movies/475557

According to the Route entry above, the Movie Details page should be rendered. However, we need to change the page's behavior so that it requests the movie's details from the API - previously we passed in the details as a prop but this was only for convenience.

In `src/pages/moviePage.js`, make the following modifications:
~~~
import React, {useState, useEffect}  from "react";
. . . . other imports . . . . .

const MoviePage = props => {
  const { id } = props.match.params;
  const [movie, setMovie] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(
      `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${id}?api_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY}`
    ).then(res => res.json())    
    .then(movie => {
      setMovie(movie);
    });
  }, [id]);

  return (
    <>
    . . . . as before . . . 
    </>
  );
};
~~~
The statement:

>const { id } = props.match.params;

extracts the movie id from the URL currently contained in the browser address bar. The useEffect hook uses the API's movie endpoint (read more [here][movie]) to get full details on the clicked movie. In the browser, click any of the movie posters. The app will navigate to the details page:

![][detailp]

In the Home page the list of genres in the filtering dropdown is hard-coded. Instead we can use the API's genre endpoint (read more [here][genres]). It returns an array of objects, for example:
~~~
[
  {
    id: '"1",
    name: "Action"
  },
  {
    id: '"2",
    name: "Adventure"
  },  {
    id: '"3",
    name: "Animation"
  },
  . . . etc
]
~~~
We need to add one extra entry to the array returned by the API - the 'all genres' case. This is assigned an id of zero to avoid clashing with other genres.  id

In `src/components/filterControls.js` completely replace the current code with the following:
~~~
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import "./filterControls.css";

const FilterControls = props => {
  const [genres, setGenres] = useState([{ id: '0', name: "All" }]);
 
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(
      "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/genre/movie/list?api_key=" +
        process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY
    )
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => json.genres)
      .then(apiGenres => {
        setGenres([genres[0], ...apiGenres]);
      });
  }, []);

  const handleChange = (e, type, value) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // To be completed
  };
  const handleTextChange = e => {
    handleChange(e, "name", e.target.value);
  };
  const handleGenreChange = e => {
    handleChange(e, "genre", e.target.value);
  };

  return (
      <div className="row bg-warning">
        <div className="col-md-12">
          <h4>
            <span>List Filtering:</span>
            <input
              type="text"
              placeholder="Title Search"
              onChange={handleTextChange}
            />
          <select id="genre" onChange={handleGenreChange}>
              {genres.map(genre => {
                return (
                  <option key={genre.id} value={genre.id}>
                    {genre.name}
                  </option>
                );
              })}
          </select>
         </h4>
        </div>
      </div>
  );

export default FilterControls;
~~~
The event handling function for the input fields above, i.e. handleChange, are incomplete for now. In the browser check the genre dropdown shows the full list of options.

Before continuing, from the integrated terminal panel, update the git repository, as follows:

$ git add -A
