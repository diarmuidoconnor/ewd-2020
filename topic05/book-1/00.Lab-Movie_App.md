# Developing a Movies Fan App.

in this lab we will enhance the static Movies Fan app from the previous session. In particular we will add:

1. Live data from the TMDB API.
1. Routing.
1. Filtering of the movie list displayed on the home page.
1. The ability to add a movie to your favorites list.

From a technical perspective this will involve using:

1. The React-Router module.
1. The useState and useEffect hooks.
