## The Filtering behavior.

The FilterControls component houses the filtering input fields, however, its parent component, HomePage, uses the filter values to compute the matching list of movies. The design solution to this problem is *the inverse data flow pattern*. Also, the input fields values are modeled as *state*, which will be located in the  HomePage component as it is the *common ancestor*.

In `src/pages/homePage.js` we need:

+ The useState hook to manage the new state variables.
+ An event handler function to respond to user changing the filtering criteria.
+ Logic to compute the subset of matching movies for the current filter input.

const MovieListPage = () => {
  const [titleFilter, setTitleFilter] = useState("");
  const [genreFilter, setGenreFilter] = useState("0");

  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    . . . as before . . . .
  } 

  const genre = Number(genreFilter);
  let displayedMovies = movies
    .filter(m => {
      return m.title.toLowerCase().search(titleFilter.toLowerCase()) !== -1;
    })
    .filter(m => {
      return genre > 0 ? m.genre_ids.includes(Number(genreFilter)) : true;
    });

  const handleFilterChange = (type, value) => {
    if (type === "name") setNameFilter(value);
    else setGenreFilter(value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Header numMovies={displayedMovies.length} />
      <FilterControls onUserInput={handleFilterChange} />
      <MovieList movies={displayedMovies} />
    </>
  );
};

export default MovieListPage;

The new prop passed down to FilterControls is a function that it calls when the user changes either of the filter inputs. In `components/filterControls/index.js` update the handleChange function as follows:
~~~
  const handleChange = (e, type, value) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    props.onUserInput(type, value);
  };
~~~

In the browser, go to the Home page and change the genre selection or type in the text box. Notice the list of matching movies are recomputed automatically.

Before continuing, from the integrated terminal panel, update the git repository, as follows:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added filtering of movie list"
