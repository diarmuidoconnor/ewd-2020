# Swagger

Swagger is a free and open source framework you can use to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to a REST API which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service.

## SwaggerHub

Using SwaggerHub,  you can define and manage your APIs using the OpenAPI Specification. It integrates the core Swagger tools into a single platform to help you coordinate the entire workflow of an APIâ€™s lifecycle (with no download/install!).

- Go to https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/ and select the "Sign up free" option.
- Sign up using your github credentials.

## Initial Simple API

You are going to design a simple Movie API that provides for the following:

> List all Movies  
> Get a Movie  
> Add a Movie  
> Update a Movie  
> Remove a Movie

This can be mapped to the following API description:

![Simple Movie API](./img/api.png)

- In SwaggerHub, click on the Create New -> Create New API.

![Create New API](./img/create.png)

- Create a Blank API with the following configuration:

![Create New API Template](./img/spec.png)

You should now see a blank YAML template similar to the following. 

![Initial Template](./img/initial-template.png)

## Paths - /api/movie 

Initially, we will update the template to describe the ``GET`` operation for ``/api/movies``. We will define responses for two HTTP statuses, 200 (all OK) and 500 (something went wrong!).

- In the paths property of the API description, replace the curly braces with the following cade:

~~~yaml
  /api/movies:
    get:
      operationId: list-movies
      summary: List Movies
      description: List movies from movie db.
      responses:
        '200':
          description: 'List of Movies'
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: {movies: [{ id: 181808, imdb_id: "tt2527336", title: "Star Wars: The Last Jedi"},
                { id: 181808, imdb_id: "tt2527336", title: "Star Wars: The Last Jedi"}]}
        '404':
            description: "401 Error"
            content: 
              application/json:
                schema:
                  type: object
                  example: {message: "unable to find Movies", code: 404}
        '500':
           description: "500 Error"
            content: 
              application/json:
                schema:
                  type: object
                  example: {message: "Internal Error", code: 500}
~~~

Swaggerhub will parse and validate the API description as you modify it. If you see any errors (indicated by red 'x's), please read the error message and attempt to resolve it. If there are any error, you will not be able to test the API. 

Click on the Save Button to save the file. 

## Add a Movie

To add a movie, we will define the POST method for the /api/movie paths. This should take a JSON object containing details

~~~yaml
    post:
      operationId: add-movie
      summary: Add a Movie
      requestBody:
        description: Movie data as JSON object  
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              example: { id: 181808, imdb_id: "tt2527336", title: "Star Wars: The Last Jedi"}
      responses:
        '201':
          description: ''
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example:
                  application/json:
                    status_code: 1
                    status_message: Success.
        '405':
          description: "405 Error"
          content: 
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: {message: "Invalid Movie Data", code: 405}
~~~

## Paths - /api/movie/{id}

Now you will add path for accessing specific movies. Each movie will have a unique ID, which is contained in the URL (/api/movies/{id}). This is known as a parameterised URL:

- Add the following code to the ``path:`` property of the API definition. Make sure the 

~~~yaml
  /api/movies/{id}:
    get:
      operationId: get-a-movie
      summary: Get a movie by id
      description: Get movie by id
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: id
          schema:
            type: integer
          required: true
          description: Unique ID of the movie to get
      responses:
        '200':
          description: 'Movie details'
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: { id: 181808, imdb_id: "tt2527336", title: "Star Wars: The Last Jedi"}
        '404':
          description: "404 Error"
          content: 
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: {message: "unable to find Movie", code: 404}
        '500':
          description: "500 Error"
          content: 
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: {message: "Internal Error", code: 500}
~~~

The above code defines the HTTP GET request/response for Movie details using movie ``id``. The parameter is inicated using curly braces in the path (i.e. {id}. Notice that the ``id`` parameter is also explicitly defined in the g``get:`` property.
If this validates, you should see the path appear in in the MovieDB API description to the right of editor. 

- Finally, add the definitions for the PUT and DELETE methods by incliding the following yaml in the ``/api/movie/{id}`` part of the definintion:

~~~yaml
    put:
      operationId: update-a-movie
      summary: Update a movie by id
      description: Update movie by id
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: id
          schema:
            type: integer
          required: true
          description: Unique ID of the movie to get
      requestBody:
        description: Movie data as JSON object  
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              example: { id: 181808, imdb_id: "tt2527336", title: "Star Wars: The Last Jedi"}
      responses:
        '200':
          description: 'Movie Updated'
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: { id: 181808, imdb_id: "tt2527336", title: "Star Wars: The Last Jedi"}
        '404':
          description: "404 Error"
          content: 
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: {message: "unable to find Movie", code: 404}
        '500':
          description: "500 Error"
          content: 
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: {message: "Internal Error", code: 500}

    delete:
      operationId: delete-a-movie
      summary: Delete a movie by id
      description: Delete movie by id
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: id
          schema:
            type: integer
          required: true
          description: Unique ID of the movie to get
      responses:
        '200':
          description: 'Movie Deleted'
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: { id: 181808, status: "deleted"}
        '404':
          description: "404 Error"
          content: 
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: {message: "unable to find Movie", code: 404}
        '500':
          description: "500 Error"
          content: 
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                example: {message: "Internal Error", code: 500}

## Swaggerhub Mock URL

Swaggerhub provides a public URL to test your API. This is useful to check the API performs as expected. You'll notice the API description has a SwaggerHub API  Mocking URL. You can test against this URL from within SwaggerHub by clicking on the "Try it out" button. This will generate a HTTP request based on the path description:

- Click on the "Try it Out" button folllowed by execute in Swaggerhub to check the response is correct (i.e. 200 and Movie Details). You should see something similar to the following:

![Mock Server - Swaggerhub](./img/mock1.png)

As it's a simple HTTP GET, you can also check out the response in a separate browser window:

- Copy and paste the request URL into the browser address field. You should see a valid response as before:

![Mock Server - Swaggerhub](./img/mock2.png)

- Use the **Try it** feature for the POST also. You cannot test this from a browser however, if your OS supports ``curl``, you can copy/paste the ``curl`` command to the terminal window and execute - it should work!
