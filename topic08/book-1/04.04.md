## Improving the API - Schemas and Examples

The Movie data model is richer than what was used in the previous example. You can define examples in the components/example section of the API specification and then re-use them in various parameter descriptions, request and response body descriptions, objects and properties.
Also, after our first version of the API, it's noted that the Movie data model is too simple and needs to be more formally defined. This can be accomplished by defining **Schemas**.

**We will use the same schema adopted in the MovieDB application used in the previous Labs**.

- Add the following example of a Movie list to the bottom of the API specification:


~~~yaml
components:
  schemas:
    movieListObject:
      title: Movie List Result Object
      type: object
      properties:
        movies:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              poster_path:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/imagePath'
              adult:
                type: boolean
              overview:
                type: string
              release_date:
                type: string
              genre_ids:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: integer
              id:
                type: integer
              original_title:
                type: string
              original_language:
                type: string
              title:
                type: string
              backdrop_path:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/imagePath'
              popularity:
                type: number
              vote_count:
                type: integer
              video:
                type: boolean
              vote_average:
                type: number
    imagePath:
      title: image-path
      type: string
      default: null
~~~


- Once the schema is in place and validated by the editor, add a reference to the schema inside the ``application/json`` propoery of successful response. Your ``200:`` response for the ``get:`` method of the ``/api/movies`` should look like this 

~~~yaml
        '200':
          description: 'List of Movies'
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/movieListObject'
          .......
~~~

Once validated, the Movie List schemas should appear in the API description on the right of the editor.

## New Movie Schema

You will now define a schema for new movies. This schema is very similar to the movieListObject schema except properties relating to ratings and reviews are removed.

- Add the following schema, ``newMovieObject`` to the existing schemas in the API definition:

~~~yaml
    newMovieObject:
      title: New Movie Object
      type: object
      properties:
        poster_path:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/imagePath'
        adult:
          type: boolean
        overview:
          type: string
        release_date:
          type: string
        genre_ids:
          type: array
          items:
            type: integer
        id:
          type: integer
        original_title:
          type: string
        original_language:
          type: string
        title:
          type: string
        backdrop_path:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/imagePath'
        video:
          type: boolean
~~~

- Replace the existing ``requestBody:`` in the ``post:`` property with the following reference to the ``newObjectSchema``:

~~~yaml
      requestBody:
        description: Movie data as JSON object  
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema: 
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/newMovieObject'
~~~

## Examples

The current response examples do not match the new schemas. They are also embedded in the path definitions. As with the schemas, we can create an examples property inside the components property of the API specification. 

- At the bottom of the ``components:`` property, add the following example responses for the GET and POST request for the /api/movies path: 

~~~yaml
 examples:
    movieListObject:
      value:
        movies:
        - title: The Avengers

- Now update the `200` response for the  ``/api/movies/`` path to include a reference to this example. The `200` property of the responses should look like the following

~~~yaml
        '200':
          description: 'List of Movies'
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/movieListObject'
              examples:
                movieListObject:
                  $ref: '#/components/examples/movieListObject'
~~~

- Similarly, update the response for the POST method to use the moveObject example:

~~~yaml
        '201':
          description: 'Successfully added new Movie'
          content:
            application/json:
              examples:
                movieListObject:
                  $ref: '#/components/examples/movieObject'
~~~

You should now be able to test your API as before. This time, the ``HTTP GET`` request for ``/api/movies`` should return a more complete response.

## Solution

The solution is contained in the https://github.com/fxwalsh/ewd-examples-2020.git repo you cloned at the start of the lab. (see week8/labs),

# Optional Exercise:

- Add GET and POST entries for the ``/api/movie/{id}`` path.

- Notice that the "failure" responses (404,405,500) all have the same format. Design a common schema to define these responses.
